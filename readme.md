# Back To The Future Trivia

[Click here](http://ianlenehan.github.io/BTTF/) to access the game!

If you haven't seen the films, this game won't make much sense to you. And you should immediately rent these films and watch them!

## The game

When opening the page, you need to click the headline to begin. You are first asked to enter your name. This is so your score appears on the leaderboard.

You have ten seconds to answer each question. The faster you answer each question, the more points you get. If you get the answer wrong, you get zero points. Obviously. If you take too long to answer the question, the headline and picture changes from Dr Emmet Brown being commended to the Doc being committed!

Again, if you haven't seen this movies, this won't make much sense to you.

After you select an answer from the left side for each question, a pop-up window appears letting you know how many points you've scored and explaining what the actual answer is. The countdown is paused until you hit the next question button.

### Features
